Homework assignment 2

This project is a prime example of something small going wrong and wrecking things, and no one able to catch the small thing. Fixing the thing took up so much time that when it was finally found, too many things had been changed in hoping to fix it, an inordinate amount of class time had passed, and I was over the project and needed to move on. So while everyone else was fine tuning their project, I was trying to get a basic function to work. 

There was input on this project from my tutor, and from some classmates, but I cannot say for certain that I really got code from anyone. My tutor helped straighten out the header. 

A friend who previously took bootcamp immediately found the problem. I will say that I was apparently on the right track before the error, and in trying to figure out the error, and having classmates look at my code, different ideas were thrown at the project to see if they would stick. After finding the problem I needed to undo the different things I had tried to fix the problem. 

I know I haven't finished all the elements, but I got the flex working, and that is what I needed to accomplish for myself. If given more time, I would have made the flex work better and made my way through the rest of the tasks. 

I'm pretty fried on this project, and can't think of anything more to describe what I did. May this project rest in peace.
